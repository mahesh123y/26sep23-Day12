            Food is the substance we eat every day for energy and strength.
            There are many different types of food, such as fruits, vegetables,
            rice, and pasta. We need to eat a variety of foods to get all the
            essential nutrients the body needs. Not eating a healthy and
            balanced diet leads to weakness and deficiency diseases.
